# rust-analyzer's path lookup looks in subdirectories by default. For example,
# in the general case, if you have multiple parallel workspaces, under say
# - A/B/C with crates X1, X2
# - A/B/D with crates Y1, Y2
# and you run rust-analyzer with A/ as the project path, it will pick up all
# crates (X1, X2, Y1 and Y2). So it is enough to run rust-analyzer once,
# instead of once per workspace, or once per crate.
